I am a very curious person. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS from online tutorials(udemy,learnvern,linkedinLearing). I started making simple websites for fun. Later, I enrolled in a computer science degree program at CT University/Ludhian/Punjab, where I learned more advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, databases and more.
I enjoyed working in teams and solving real-world problems with code.
